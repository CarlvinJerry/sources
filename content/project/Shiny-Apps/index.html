<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>This project contains links to my developed shiny apps you might find helpful…For every new interesting idea I have I’ll build an app. Some might be basic shiny, others might be complex shiny, depending on how important I think they are. Let me know what you think,suggestions for improvements and new apps are welcome.</p>
