<h2>Getting started with Text mining using Twitter and R</h2>
<p>Social media usage has grown rapidly over the past few decades, most social networks we can think of now are so well established, making them a platform where people can not only talk to one another but also be able to come forward with different views and interests they would like to express. With an almost constant rate of increasing users each day, social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have become great sources of data which can be used in the broad field of Data Science:Talk of (those pretty annoying) targeted ads for example…</p>

<p>With the help of APIs, we are easily able to get data from such platforms to be used for further analysis. In this article we will go through the first step of text mining in R using data fetched from Twitter. The main advantage of these APIs is that the data we will fetch comes in a well-structured format which makes our work easier when crunching. In this case we will use the readily available Twitter API and create our own Twitter app that will then help in fetching the data. The following steps will accomplish the task…</p>
<div id="creating-a-twitter-app" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating a Twitter app</h3>
<p>To create a twitter app we can use for fetching metadata, we first need to have a Twitter account. We then need to go to the <strong>twitter dev site</strong> <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/" class="uri">https://developer.twitter.com/</a> and log in with our user account. On the top right corner should be a drop down menu next to your username, go to APPS. At this point if you are doing this for the first time your Apps section should be blank. Click on “Create an app” to… create an app.</p>

</div>
<p>We then have to fill in the form bellow appropriately. Here is a breakdown of what’s required:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> Give your app a unique name of your choice, e.g <strong>UniqueName</strong></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> This can always be changed later, use this to provide a brief note on what your app is all about to be able to distinguish it from other apps you might create in future.</li>
<li><strong>Website:</strong> This should be your application’s home page web site. It is however not applicable for most personal apps. Anything goes here e.g <a href="https://carlvinjerry.github.io" class="uri">https://carlvinjerry.github.io</a></li>
<li><strong>Callback URL:</strong> I would ignore the Callback URL field. If you are allowing users to log into your app to authenticate themselves, you’d enter the URL where they would be returned after they’ve given permission to Twitter to use your app.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>The remaining fields should be quite straight forward but must be filled. Click “Create” once done and there you have your first twitter app. On your app is a menu with <strong>Keys and tokens</strong>. These are the most important components since we will need them to access data from the APIs.Generate both consumer and access token if not preceent and take note of them. <strong>NB:</strong> <strong>These keys are meant for your eyes only!</strong></p>

</div>
<p>The final bit of setting up our twitter app is granting access permissions. We will mostly do fine with the <strong>read-only</strong> if all we need is to fetch data but it can always be changed later. knitr::include_graphics(J:/Personalprojects/Blogsite/sources/static/post/MyImages/permisions.png)</p>

<p>Now we can move on to the next step where we set up <strong>R</strong> to query data from Twitter.</p>
