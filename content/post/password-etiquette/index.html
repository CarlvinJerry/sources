<blockquote>
<p>I got bitten by the famous procrastination bug earlier this year, so I missed out on #TidyTuesday’s week 3(2020) challenge. As a make-up, I thought I should do it here instead and maybe someone will learn one or two things about security, digital privacy to be precise.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Exposing ourselves to cyber attacks comes as easy as having access to the internet. Almost every website you visit will require you to create an account to be able to access significant information or services from them - So where exactly does the problem with password strength begin? Memory methinks…</p>
<p>The whole purpose of memory is to preserve information. Events, names, faces, mathematical formulae etcetera, all seem recorgnizable every time we recollect because the mind memorizes them. I don’t know how exactly remembering works, but you will agree with me on this; the memory is sometimes very unreliable when it comes to cramming passwords. It is for this very reason that, in the quest for memorizing our passwords, we find ourselves using weak passwords.</p>
<p>Different folk memorize passwords differently; some of us share passwords across platforms (very counter intuitive if you actually think about it re cyber security), some use personal information such as names, birthdays, spouse names(ha!) and what have you. My point is, we cannot fully trust ourselves to match brute force algorithms trying to hack their way into our facebook(s), instagram(s) and worse for me, online banking and credit card acconts. So here are a few Ps and Qs for setting up passwords.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small task <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">here</a>, check how long it would take a computer to crack your bank account password.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-14/readme.md">#TidyTuesday’s passwords</a> data for illustration. To keep it concise, all the code used in this hidden, click the <code>CODE</code> button to expand if you wish to see the code. Shout out to my good friend and avid data analyst Martin who helped in building a password strength metter used in ranking passwords used here, you can read more on the tool (here)[<a href="https://ndirangumartin.netlify.app/post/password-meter-in-r/" class="uri">https://ndirangumartin.netlify.app/post/password-meter-in-r/</a>]. That being said, let’s get visual.</p>
<p>The graph bellow show a scattered distribution of a small fraction of our compromised passwords. You want to ensure that if your passwords happen to be on this chart, they are on the bottom far left of the chart i.e, the passwords are unique and exhibit stronger strengths. That way, you know that even a computer will take quite some time before cracking it. The further and lower it is along the x-axis, the greener and stronger it is.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>dim(mobileBanking.Df)

<p>The data set has 43 rows with 11 Variables. We therefore explore the data types of each variable/column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Check Categorical VS Numeric Characters----
cat_vars &lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.character))]
cat_vars

numeric_vars &lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.numeric))]
numeric_vars
## character(0)</code></pre>
<p>To identify the data types, we can check for numeric and categorical variables present in the data. In our case, all the variables in our data set are categorical. We will therefore explore the data from a categorical approach rather than numeric. There exists different visualization methods for different data types. Now that we have established the general structure of the data, we can check for missing values, <code>NAs</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Checking data for any missing values
colSums(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.na))
##                       Gender                    Age.Range 
##                            0                            0

##                      Benefit                   Bank.Visit

##                            0</code></pre>
<p>We have no columns with missing values in our data. We can therefore proceed to analysis without worrying about missing values. In a case whereby there exists NA values, one can choose whether to replace the nulls with the most appropriate values or remove the rows with nulls from the data. This is important for later stages of analysis that include data modelling, like Machine Learning.</p>

<p>The base R <code>Summary()</code> function comes in handy at summarizing data. In our case, there is no statistical measures since all our variables are categorical. Note that the function also specifies the specific data types. There are more than enough ways to inspect data structures in R.</p>

<h3>2.0.0 Getting Insights from the data</h3>
<div id="descriptive-statistics-for-categorical-data" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.0 Descriptive Statistics For Categorical Data</h4>
<p>The main goal of descriptive statistics is to inform data analysts on the main features of either numerical or categorical data, using sample summaries represented as either tables, individual numbers or charts and graphs. Since we only have categorical data, I will illustrate the most used forms of descriptive statistics for the same. However, like I mentioned earlier, there are more than enough ways to analyze data in R.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="frequencies" class="section level5">
<h5>2.1.1 Frequencies</h5>
<p><strong>Frequencies</strong> illustrate the number of occurrences or observations of a particular category in data. We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table">contigency tables</a> to present this information. In R this can be achieved using the <strong><em>table()</em></strong> function.</p>
<p>From out data, the total distribution of respondents based on gender looks like this;</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Gender frequencies
#library(kableExtra)
table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender)
## 
## Female   Male 
##     20     23</code></pre>
<p>We can illustrate multiple attributes using cross classification tables such as;</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#library(kableExtra)
# Cross classification counts for gender by Mobile banking safety opinion
table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety)
##         
##          NotAtAll Somewhat Very
##   Female        3       11    6
##   Male          0       19    4</code></pre>
<p>Multidimensional tables with three or more categories can also be achieved using the <strong><em>ftable()</em></strong> . As an example, let’s check out the number of respondents based on gender, mobile banking safety opinion and how often they visit the bank.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Counts by gender, opinion and bank visits
table_ &lt;- table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety, mobileBanking.Df$Bank.Visit)
ftable(table_)
##                  FewTimesAyear OnceMonth
##                                         
## Female NotAtAll              3         0
##        Somewhat             11         0
##        Very                  5         1
## Male   NotAtAll              0         0

</div>
<div id="proportions" class="section level5">
<h5>2.1.1 Proportions</h5>
<p>Proportions are basically contingency tables represented as percentages. From our previous tables, we can do proportions for the same by applying <strong><em>prop.table()</em></strong> to output produced by the *<strong>table()</strong> function. Proportions for the above will then be;</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#library(kableExtra)
#Gender frequencies proportions
prop.table(table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender))

</div>
<div id="marginals" class="section level5">
<h5>2.1.2 Marginals</h5>
<p>Marginals measure counts across columns or rows in a contingency table. <strong><em>Margin.table()</em></strong> gives us the frequencies while <strong><em>prop.table()</em></strong> gives us the percentages. Using our previous examples on frequencies;</p>
<pre class="r"><code># FREQUENCY MARGINALS

This could be probably because the older people chose not to participate in the survey as opposed to the younger ones, or that they somehow never got to opportunity to do so.
