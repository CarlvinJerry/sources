<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Here’s a fun fact; An average human being (probably an adult) makes close to 30,000 conscious decisions every day. This isn’t entirely true though, in fact, I just made that number up. I could be right because if you think about it, how many decisions would you say you make on a day to day basis? Depending on who you are the above obviously varies widely and you know best. We all make <strong><strong>n</strong></strong> decisions every day- what to do, eat, buy or hit. The real question however is, do our daily choices solely depend on our consciousness? Are there any other factors at hand that influence our decision making process? Are all these factors, if any, always straight forward choices or do we sometimes get <strong>“nudged”</strong> into these choices we make?</p>
<p><strong>Nudge theory</strong> basically states that; by understanding how people think and what drives their decisions, we can use those factors to steer them into making decisions differently, through positive reinforcement. Research has shown that, by presenting choices differently rather than in a legislative manner, people can be influenced into making specific desired choices. This theory is widely used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics"><strong>behavioral economics</strong></a> by presenting subtle <strong>nudge units</strong> intended to influence people’s thoughts about financial products. The theory was however initially more of a moral aspect meant to help people make better decisions in life and not as a tool for commercial gain. Over years of practice, different applications of the theory emerged.</p>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of what nudge theory is about, we can explore an applicable example. This post mainly focuses on a short research project I happened to be part of, actually my first hackathon experience hosted by Safaricom PLC. Let’s dive in!</p>

<h4>TOOLS USED:</h4>
<p>Our twitter data was fetched using <strong>R</strong>, I have done a post on setting up a twitter API to fetch twitter data <a href="https://beyondrawdata.rbind.io/2019/01/25/data-mining-in-r/">here</a>. <strong>R</strong> has several packages (such as <strong>“tweeteR”</strong> and <strong>“rtweet”</strong>) that one can use to stream data from twitter. Our data cleaning and pre-processing was mainly done in <strong>Python</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To keep this post concise, code for the workings has been minimized. <a href="https://github.com/CarlvinJerry/sources/blob/master/content/post/2019-02-20-digital-nudging-rmd.Rmd">The source code for this post can be found here,</a> for anyone interested in trying out the same process. The code is well commented for easier understanding as well.</p>

<div id="fetching-data" class="section level5">
<h5>1.Fetching Data</h5>
<p>The team agreed on a few terms to query data on from twitter. For an unbiased range of topics, we settled on fetching tweets under trending topics and a few more from random words. We had tweets from or containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>#MenConference2019</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>“Here”</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>#r_Stats</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>“PWC”</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>#Friday Feeling</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A total of <strong>7000 tweets</strong> were captured. The data frame had a total of 88 columns which we treated as variables for the research. However, not all variables were used in the research we therefore had to do some data cleaning. Here is a preview of the variables in our raw data.</p>

<h5>2.Data pre-processing.</h5>
<p>This stage involved cleaning up our data by removing the unwanted columns/variables. We decided to do with a select few variables we thought would be most appropriate for our case study. We chose the following <strong>seven variables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text</strong> - This column contained the actual tweets text.</li>
<li><strong>Verified</strong> - whether or not the user is verified on twitter.</li>
<li><strong>Protected</strong> - Whether a user is or isn’t protected (Locked accounts).</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> - Based on our challenge stated in the <strong>figure above</strong>, this variable was our most important variable. Rows with <strong>NULL</strong> values for location simply meant that the specific user <strong>DID NOT GEOTAG</strong> their tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Followers Count</strong> - Number of followers the user had.</li>
<li><strong>Retweet Verifie</strong> - Whether the tweet had been retweeted by a verified user or not.</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong> - Source of the tweet i.e “Android”, “web client” e.t.c</li>
</ul>

<div id="model-specifications" class="section level4">
<h4>3.Model Specifications</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of our problem,(we had several uncorrelated variables) we decided to do a classification analysis. This means we had to come up with a classifier model to regress <strong>n</strong> variables based on our dependent variable, the <strong>Location</strong> variable. The main challenge of classifier models is knowing what really goes on inside the models that leads to the final output. Even with higher levels of accuracy in some models, it is quite difficult o understand the paths of a given model. However, using <strong>Random forests</strong> and <strong>Decision Tree</strong> classifiers can give us a graphical representation of the criteria followed by the models to arrive at a given output. Another upper hand of decision tree models is that they require minimal data cleaning, less time consuming. Here is a detailed read on <a href="https://medium.com/x8-the-ai-community/decision-trees-an-intuitive-introduction-86c2b39c1a6c">how decision trees work</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsetting-data-to-train-test-sets" class="section level4">
<h4>SUBSETTING DATA TO <code>TRAIN</code> &amp; <code>TEST</code> SETS</h4>
<p>For the training and test data sets, we randomly split our data set into two sates. Usually, the best practice is to train the model with with a larger proportion of the data set. We therefore took <strong>80%</strong> for training and <strong>20%</strong> for test purposes.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="model-training" class="section level4">
<h4>MODEL TRAINING</h4>
<p>We trained our decision tree model to predict a <strong>class</strong> “location”. Whether a location is <strong>geotagged</strong> or <strong>not geotagged</strong> based on whether the user is verified, protected, has over 500 followers, is retweeted by another verified user and the number of characters in their tweet. Bellow is the visual output of the trained model.</p>

Figure 2: The Tree

</figure>
</center>
<p>When interpreting decision trees, you start at the root node. The root node is the one on top of the decision tree. Since what we want is those nodes with geotagged locations, it is safe to ignore the non-tagged nodes. Note that our highest entropy level was observed on one variable only, the number of characters in the tweet text. This might not always be the case with decision trees though, it is possible to have more than one factor. In such situations, it is best to run several decision trees to build a <strong>random forest</strong> and make a decision based on the most prevalent variables.<br />
For our case, we only focus on what we found:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>At the top node, we can see the overall probability of a user geotagging their tweets. <strong>75 percent</strong> of the users in the training set geotagged their tweets. not</p></li>
<li><p>Our second node asks whether the number of characters are <strong>more than 134</strong> and goes to depth 2 where we can observe the <strong>highest number of users tweeted more than 134 characters</strong> at <strong>80 percent</strong> with an <strong>80 percent probability</strong> of geotagging their tweets.</p></li>
<li><p>Node 3 checks if the number of characters in a tweet is <strong>less than 134</strong>. If yes, head to depth 3, where we can see that <strong>20 percent</strong> of users had less than 134 characters with a <strong>50 percent probability</strong> of geotagging their tweets.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, looking at depth 4 which originates from the node that checks is number of characters is <strong>equal to or more than 122</strong>, we can see that <strong>12 percent</strong> of users had tweets with character equal to or more than 124, with <strong>88 percent probability</strong> of geotagging their tweets.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<div id="model-testing-and-performance-accuracy." class="section level5">
<h5>3.1 Model Testing and performance accuracy.</h5>
<p>With our model trained and outputs observed, we were able to run a test with our test subset. Here is our confusion matrix.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="confusion-matrix" class="section level4">
<h4>CONFUSION MATRIX</h4>
<pre><code>          predict_geotags
             NON-TAGGED TAGGED
  NON-TAGGED         90    248
  TAGGED              2   1043</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="model-accuracy" class="section level4">
<h4>MODEL ACCURACY</h4>
<pre><code>&gt; #performance
&gt; accuracy_Test &lt;- sum(diag(table_mat)) / sum(table_mat)
&gt; print(paste(&#39;Accuracy for test is&#39;, accuracy_Test))
[1] &quot;Accuracy for test is 0.819233550253073&quot;</code></pre>
<p>From the confusion matrix above, we can observe that the model had a <strong>true negative of 90 predictions</strong>. That is, 90 predictions were correctly predicted as not geotagged. A <strong>false positive of 248 predictions</strong> was observed where the model wrongly predicted 248 tweets were geotagged whereas in real sense they were not.</p>
<p>For the tagged tweets, we had a <strong>false negative of 2 predictions</strong> against a <strong>true positive of 1043 predictions</strong>. This means that our model was able to correctly predict 1043 geotagged tweets from the test data. The accuracy of the model turned out pretty good, at an <strong>82 percent accuracy level</strong>. The theoretical formula for the accuracy is the proportion of true positives and the true negatives divided by the sum of the confusion matrix.</p>
<center>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\]</span></p>
</center>
<p>For a better accuracy level, the model’s hyper-parameters can be tweaked to improve performance. Another option is implementing a random forest test.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion-recommendation" class="section level4">
<h4>CONCLUSION &amp; RECOMMENDATION</h4>
<p>With our decision tree model, we were able to attain a high level of accuracy for a model that test whether users with <strong>tweets containing characters equal to or above 122</strong> are likely to geotag their tweets. Our <strong>nudge</strong> in this case is the number of characters in a tweet and precisely, <strong>124 or more</strong>. Our recommendation therefore would be to encourage users to tweet longer or engage them in trending topics that require one to write more, for example a TT like # MyLifeHistoryInANutshell…-in the hope that a user will eventually geotag their tweet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come to think of it, did twitter really increase the number of characters just for tweeps to tweet more and as they said, to get more people to join twitter? I have a theory, it was a NUDGE!</p>
