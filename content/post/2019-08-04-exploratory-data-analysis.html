<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>If you are familiar with data analysis then I’m certain that you fully relate to the above statement. After all, it would be pointless to play around with lots of data just for the love of it.</p>
<p>Data is gold, and the more you have the better off you are. However, raw unprocessed data is of no use unless you manipulate and gain insights from it. Before embarking on statistical modelling and visualization of your data, it is very important to first have an understanding of the data itself. Exploratory Data Analysis (<strong>EDA</strong>) aids in visualization, transformation, and generally cleaning or remodeling data before diving deep into statistics and predictive modelling.</p>
<p>There are not set rules to be followed when performing EDA. As a data reparation phase, one is allowed to decide what suits them best in order to gain an understanding of their data. However, there are two most important questions one should seek to answer while studying their data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there variation within my variables?</li>
<li>Is there any correlation between my variables?</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, EDA involves the following checks among others:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong> - Give a summarized understanding of the data, usually as measures of central tendency and variability.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean</strong> - Arithmetic average</li>
<li><strong>Median</strong> - middle value</li>
<li><strong>Mode</strong> - most frequent value</li>
<li><strong>Standard Deviation</strong> - variation from the mean</li>
<li><strong>Kurtosis</strong> -peakedness of the data distribution</li>
<li><strong>Skewness</strong> - symmetry of the data distribution</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Groupings of data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Missing values</strong></li>
<li><strong>ANOVA:</strong> Analysis of variance</li>
<li><strong>Graphical visualization</strong>, not restricted to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Histogram</strong> -frequency bar plots</li>
<li><strong>Density estimation</strong> - an estimation if the frequency distribution based on sample data</li>
<li><strong>Box plots</strong> - A visual representation of median, quantiles, symmetry and ourtliers</li>
<li><strong>Scatter plots</strong> - a graphical display of variables plotted on the x and y axes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we will perform EDA on a sample data set containing responses on mobile banking survey in Kenya. If you would like to follow along with the same data, you can download it <a href="https://github.com/CarlvinJerry/sources/blob/master/data/Mobile%20Banking%20in%20Kenya.csv">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-importation" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Importation</h2>
<p>The code chunk below imports our data set into R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Loading Data into R  toc_depth: 2
mobileBanking.Df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;J:\\Personalprojects\\Blogsite\\sources\\data\\Mobile Banking in Kenya.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE )
mobileBanking.Df &lt;- mobileBanking.Df[,-1] #Remove the number column which is Irrelevant</code></pre>
<div id="data-inspection" class="section level3">
<h3>1.0.0 Data Inspection</h3>
<p>Once our sample data set loaded, we can check for features present in it. We first need to load all the libraries needed for data analysis and manipulation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code> #Load required packages or install if not present.----
load.libraries &lt;- c(&#39;data.table&#39;,&#39;tidyverse&#39;,&#39;gridExtra&#39;, &#39;corrplot&#39;, &#39;GGally&#39;, &#39;ggplot2&#39;, &#39;e1071&#39;, &#39;dplyr&#39;)
install.lib &lt;- load.libraries[!load.libraries %in% installed.packages()]

for(libs in install.lib) install.packages(libs, dependences = TRUE)

#Load libraries and flag TRUE
sapply(load.libraries, require, character = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>The function above takes in a list of required libraries, checks if they are already installed and installs them if not. It then loads all the packages one at a go.</p>

<h4>1.1.0 Observing the data structure</h4>
<pre class="r"><code>dim(mobileBanking.Df)
## [1] 43 11</code></pre>
<p>The data set has 43 rows with 11 Variables. We therefore explore the data types present in each variable column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Check Categorical VS Numeric Characters----
cat_vars &lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.character))]

## [11] &quot;Satisfaction&quot;

numeric_vars &lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.numeric))]
numeric_vars
## character(0)</code></pre>
<p>To identify the data types, we can check for numeric and categorical variables present in the data. In our case, all the variables in our data set are categorical variables. We will therefore explore the data from a categorical approach rather than numeric. There exists different visualization methods for different data types. Now that we have established the general structure of the data, we can check if there are any missing values within the variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Checking data for any missing values
colSums(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.na))
##                       Gender                    Age.Range

##                            0</code></pre>
<p>We have no NULL values in our data. We can therefore proceed to analysis without worrying about missing values. In a case whereby there exists null values, one can choose whether to replace the nulls with the most appropriate values or remove the rows with nulls from the data. This is important for later stages of analysis that include data modelling, like Machine Learning.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Summary()</em></strong> function comes in handy at summarizing data. I our case, there is no statistical measures since all our variables are categorical. Important to note that the function also specifies the specific data types. There are more than enough ways to inspect data structures in R.</p>

<h3>2.0.0 Getting Insights from the data</h3>
<div id="descriptive-statistics-for-categorical-data" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.0 Descriptive Statistics For Categorical Data</h4>
<p>The main goal of descriptive statistics is to inform data analysts on the main features of either numerical or categorical data, using sample summaries represented as either tables, individual numbers or charts and graphs. Since we only have categorical data, I will illustrate the most used forms of descriptive statistics for the same. However, like I mentioned earlier, there are more than enough ways to analyze data in R.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="frequencies" class="section level5">
<h5>2.1.1 Frequencies</h5>
<p><strong>Frequencies</strong> illustrate the number of occurrences or observations of a particular category in data. We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table">contigency tables</a> to present this information. In R this can be achieved using the <strong><em>table()</em></strong> function.</p>
<p>From out data, the total distribution of respondents based on gender looks like this;</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Gender frequencies
#library(kableExtra)
table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender)
## 
## Female   Male 
##     20     23</code></pre>
<p>We can illustrate multiple attributes using cross classification tables such as;</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#library(kableExtra)
# Cross classification counts for gender by Mobile banking safety opinion
table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety)
##         
##          NotAtAll Somewhat Very
##   Female        3       11    6
##   Male          0       19    4</code></pre>
<p>Multidimensional tables with three or more categories can also be achieved using the <strong><em>ftable()</em></strong> . As an example, let’s check out the number of respondents based on gender, mobile banking safety opinion and how often they visit the bank.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Counts by gender, opinion and bank visits
table_ &lt;- table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety, mobileBanking.Df$Bank.Visit)
ftable(table_)
##                  FewTimesAyear OnceMonth

<div id="proportions" class="section level5">
<h5>2.1.1 Proportions</h5>
<p>Proportions are basically contingency tables represented as percentages. From our previous tables, we can do proportions for the same by applying <strong><em>prop.table()</em></strong> to output produced by the *<strong>table()</strong> function. Proportions for the above will then be;</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#library(kableExtra)

<div id="marginals" class="section level5">
<h5>2.1.2 Marginals</h5>
<p>Marginals measure counts across columns or rows in a contingency table. <strong><em>Margin.table()</em></strong> gives us the frequencies while <strong><em>prop.table()</em></strong> gives us the percentages. Using our previous examples on frequencies;</p>

<p>A majority of respondents were younger guys between age <strong>21-30</strong>, followed by the <strong>31-40</strong> age bracket. The least respondents were those above age <strong>41</strong>. This could be probably because the older people chose not to participate in the survey as opposed to the younger ones, or that they somehow never got to opportunity to do so.
