Hello, I'm Carlvin, a lover of data.

My main skills are data analysis; including manipulation and visualization, statitics and predictive modeling. As a quantitative analyst, I develop and test existing to new models for financial markets analysis. I can work with **R**, **Python**, **F#** and the **Microsoft Azure** machine learning platform.

In the night, I love to analyze data, create visualizations to extract meaningful insights and explore different statistical concepts and their applications in real world problems.

This is my website and or blog, here you will find my research work in posts, talks I partake in and my data science projects. Feel free to read, comment or offer new suggestions.
